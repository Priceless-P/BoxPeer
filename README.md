# BoxPeer

BoxPeer is a content distribution network (CDN) and decentralized file-sharing platform. It uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute content across multiple nodes, ensuring data redundancy, availability, and security. Users can upload files, serve as nodes to share others' content, and earn rewards for participating in the network. The platform integrates with Aptos blockchain technology for a good user experience.
